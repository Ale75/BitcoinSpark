# Spark Bitcoin 

## Getting Started

This applciation read rawblock from zmq bitcoind publisher.
Use Spark to manage all transactions of bitcoin's blockchain
It's tested on Ubuntu 17.10

### Prerequisites

 * JDK 1.8
 * Git
 * ZMQ
 * Bitcoind server
 * Maven >= 3.5

#### Installing JDK 1.8

Install Java Development Kit

```
    sudo apt-get install default-jdk
```

Set JAVA_HOME

```
    sudo nano /etc/environment
```

At the end of this file, add the following line, making sure to replace the highlighted path with your own copied path.

```
    JAVA_HOME="/usr/lib/jvm/java-8-oracle"
```

Save and exit the file, and reload it.

```
    source /etc/environment
```

#### Installing Git

Install Git

```
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install git
```

#### Install ZMQ and jZMQ

ZeroMQ (also known as Ã˜MQ, 0MQ, or zmq) looks like an embeddable networking library but acts like a concurrency framework. 
It gives you sockets that carry atomic messages across various transports like in-process, inter-process, TCP, and multicast.

```
    wget http://download.zeromq.org/zeromq-2.1.7.tar.gz
    tar -xzf zeromq-2.1.7.tar.gz
    cd zeromq-2.1.7
    ./configure
    make
    sudo make install
```

To use it in Java applications ZMQ use a wrapper called JZMQ. Follow this steps to install.

```
    git clone https://github.com/nathanmarz/jzmq.git
    cd jzmq
    ./autogen.sh
    ./configure
    make
    sudo make install
    sudo ldconfig
```

If make doesn't work, changing **classdist_noinst.stamp** to **classnoinst.stamp** in **src/Makefile.am**
and then re-running *./autogen.sh* seems to fix the issue.

#### Install bitcoind

Bitcoind is a program that implements the Bitcoin protocol for remote procedure call (RPC) use. 


```
   sudo apt-get install build-essential
   sudo apt-get install libtool autotools-dev autoconf
   sudo apt-get install libssl-dev
   sudo apt-get install libboost-all-dev
   sudo add-apt-repository ppa:bitcoin/bitcoin
   sudo apt-get update
   sudo apt-get install bitcoind
```
This application use testnet network to get transactions from Blockchain.
To start bitcoind with this option follow this steps
```
    mkdir ~/.bitcoin/ && cd ~/.bitcoin/
    nano bitcoind.conf
```

Append this rows
```
    # Run on the test network instead of the real bitcoin network.
    testnet=1
    
    # Enable bitcoind to send blocks without witness 
    # https://github.com/bitcoinj/bitcoinj/issues/1348
    -rpcserialversion=0
    

```

Finally, to enable the zmq bitcoind publisher append into **bitcoind.conf** this row
```
    zmqpubrawblock=tcp://127.0.0.1:28332

``` 
So, when a new transaction is coming, bitcoind publish it on **rawblock** topic

To start bitcoind
```
    bitcoind -daemon
```

To stop bitcoind
 ```
    bitcoind-cli stop
```

#### Install Maven

To install maven use
```
    sudo apt-get install maven
```

### Compile and Start Code

Download source code and import as maven project in Eclipse/IntelliJ

Compilation is made with: ``` mvn clean install ```

Run the application as Java Application.
